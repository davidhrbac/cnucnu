Fedora Django Authentication Backend

The django.auth package provides an authentication backend for Django
projects.

------------------
fedora.django.auth
------------------

As FAS users are authenticated they are added to
:class:`~fedora.django.auth.models.FasUser`. FAS groups are added to
:class:`~django.contrib.auth.models.Group` both during ``syncdb`` and when
a user is authenticated.

Integrating into a Django Project
=================================

Add the following lines to the project's :file:`settings.py`::

    AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = (
        'fedora.django.auth.backends.FasBackend',
    )

    FAS_USERNAME = '<username>'
    FAS_PASSWORD = '<password>'
    FAS_USERAGENT = '<user agent>'
    FAS_URL = '<base URL of FAS server>'
    FAS_ADMINS = ( ... )

``FAS_USERNAME`` and ``FAS_PASSWORD`` are used to retrieve group
information during ``syncdb`` as well as to retrieve users via the
authentication backend. They should be set to a low-privilege account
that can read group and user information.

``FAS_USERAGENT`` is the string used to identify yourself to the FAS
server.

``FAS_URL`` is the base URL of the FAS server to authenticate against.

``FAS_ADMINS`` is a tuple of usernames that you want to have superuser
rights in the Django project.

Add ``fedora.django.auth.middleware.FasMiddleware`` to the
``MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES`` tuple, between 
``django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware`` and
``django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware``.

Additionally, set ``FAS_GENERICEMAIL`` to ``False`` in order to use the
email address specified in FAS instead of <username>``@fedoraproject.org``.

Add ``fedora.django.auth`` to ``INSTALLED_APPS``.

.. warning::
    The ``User.first_name`` and ``User.last_name`` attributes are always
    empty since FAS does not have any equivalents. The ``name``
    read-only property results in a round trip to the FAS server.
