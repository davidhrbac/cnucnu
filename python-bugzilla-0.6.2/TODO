For 0.7:
- Rework CLI option parsing using OptionGroups
- Rename Bugzilla.query() to Bugzilla.search()
- make Bugzilla methods all take a bug ID list
  - BZ 3 methods all take idlist
  - RHBZ can use multicall to emulate that
- Add .fields() method to Bug object
- Handle attachments cleanly on RHBZ and BZ3/BZ4
- Proper _getbugssimple for BZ3.6(?) and higher using 'include_fields'
- Handle weirdness with Bug fields with .search() vs. getbugs()

General:
- i18n for strings!
- Fix up selftest.py (it's a big fat mess)
  - Actual unit tests would be a better idea.
- better documentation for abstract methods in BugzillaBase
- more consistent calls for abstract methods. 
  - fix bz.createbug(description=desc,...) vs. bug.close(comment=desc,...)
  - use field_aliases to fix up bug.close and friends?
- make the abstract methods return stuff closer to Bugzilla3's return values
- Document the 0.x API as it stands

Someday:
- All new, cleaner 1.x API
  - classes for Attachments, Users, Flags, etc.
  - Stop exposing 'internals' at Bug toplevel
  - Differentiate between upstream and custom fields
  - Drop some special-purpose methods in favor of modify()
