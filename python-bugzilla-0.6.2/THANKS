code to python-bugzilla (in order by when their name appears in 'git log'):

Luke Macken <lmacken@redhat.com>
Don Zickus <dzickus@redhat.com>
Jon Stanley <jonstanley@gmail.com>
Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@fedoraproject.org>
Michal Vyskocil <mvyskocil@suse.cz>
Eduardo Habkost <ehabkost@redhat.com>

If presented with the opportunity, you should buy them a beer (or some other
beverage of their choice).
